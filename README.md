# ELEN4020-Lab-1
Introduction to parallel computing using matricies 

# Compile Instructions
This lab is written in C and the code was tested on one of the DLab workstation machines in the 3rd/4th year section. In order to emulate the results recorded in the lab report as close as possible, please note the following:

* The linux version is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* The compiler is gcc version 5.5.0-12
* GNU Make version 4.1 is used to compile the source code

In order to produce the results, clone the repository and run the **compute.sh** script in the **scripts** folder.
The script will compile all the source code located in the **src** folder
One compiled the executable files can be found in the **executables** folder.
The MakeFile can also be found in the **executables** folder
Miscilanious scripts used to run the algorithm are found in the **scripts** folder.

The results will be shown in the terminal window.
